# Basic ruby exercises

1. Describe what a class is in Ruby in a few sentences.

2. Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the two numbers in Ruby

3. What is similar and what is different between the this implementation and the one in Javascript (exercise 3)?

4. Write a function that takes an array as an argument and prints out the numbers in the array that are greater than 5 (for example foo([3,6,1,7]) would print out 6 and 7) in Ruby

5. What is similar and what is different between the this implementation and the one in Javascript (exercise 4)?

6. Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18") in Ruby

7. Classes

 a. Create a Celsius class, that takes the temperature as a parameter.

 b. In that same class, define a method that returns the temperature in Fahrenheit. For the conversion we can use the formula temperature*1.8 + 32. Round up the result so it doesn’t contain any decimal values.
 
 c. In that same class, create a to_s method, that returns the Celsius temperature formatted e.g. 16 degrees C
