9. Using Javascript, please write a function foo, that takes two arguments, an array and a number, and returns true if the length of the array is equal to the second argument? E.g. `foo([1, 2, 3], 3)` would return true.
10. Write a loop in Javascript, iterating over the array [1, 2, 3, 4] printing out if the element is eiter the first element (print `first - `), the last element (print `last`) or neither first or last element (print `not first or last -`). E.g. the expected output would be (`first - not first or last - not first or last - last`)
